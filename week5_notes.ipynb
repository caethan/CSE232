      "Alright, today we're going to talk about binary numbers, binary operations, and how to use them effectively.  These are useful not only because they'll give you a better understanding of how integer operations are handled, but because the binary representation of integers can be useful as a way to concisely represent system states or subsets of items.\n",

      "Each digit corresponds to a power of two, and contains either a 0 or a 1, and the integer is the appropriate sum of the powers of two; in this case, 16 + 4 + 2 = 22.  Most programming languages use integers with a fixed number of digits (generally 32), in which case only numbers up to $2^N - 1$ are storable, and trying to manipulate integers larger than this will cause overflow problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Signed (that is, marked as positive or negative) integers are more complicated.  Historically there have been several different ways to represent negative integers in binary, but we're only going to talk about the current most common way, which is found in nearly every modern programming language, including C, C++, Java, and Python, the two's complement method.  Let's start with an eight bit number:\n",

      "If the bit in that position is zero, then the number is identical as under the unsigned representation.  If it is 1, then the number is negative, because the highest order place value has a large absolute value than the sum of all the other place values, and the remaining digits count up from that maximal negative value.  This then limits the range of representable values from $-2^{N-1}$ to $2^{N-1} - 1$."

      "There are some special bitwise binary operations that are meant to act on integers not as numbers but as strings of binary digits.  These operations are usually very fast, because they compile to very concise machine code, and are often even faster than basic arithmatic operation.  Notation will vary from language to language, but the tokens I'll show are fairly standard.  Be warned that due to the ubiquitous two's complement system, binary operations on *negative* numbers don't always give you the answer you expect!\n",

(I.e., if both the bit in the first input AND the second input is on, then it is on in the output.) Usually notated by an ampersand, '&'. For example:\n",

The new highest order bit is always 0 for positive numbers, but for negative numbers it depends on the implementation whether it is a 0, as for positive numbers (called a logical shift) or a 1 for the sign bit (called an arithmetic shift).  Similarly for left-shifts the bits shifted off the register are discarded and a new 0 bit enters the lowest-order position.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should note that left shifting is equivalent to multiplying by 2 and right shifting equivalent to dividing by 2 and rounding down (towards negative infinity, not towards zero), and so can be useful substitutes for multiplication and division by powers of 2 (as these operations are much faster).\n",

      "#### Bitmasks\n",
      "\n",
      "Basic knowledge of these tools will be useful for particular problems dealing directly with binary arithmetic, but by far the most common way you can use binary representation of integers in the context of a programming challenge is as a bitmask.  A bitmask is the use of the binary representation of an integer to represent a (small) vector of booleans, with each bit in the representation standing in for a particular element.  Bitmasks can represent, for example, a particular subset of elements in a set of 10 total elements:  the first 10 digits of the number correspond to whether or not each element is present in the subset:\n",

      "\n",
      "This representation makes several things quite easy.  For one, we can quickly iterate through all subsets.  Each subset is represented by an integer from 0 (no elements selected) to $2^{10} - 1$ (all elements selected), so we can simply loop through these integers and ensure we have covered each possible subset.  Secondly, there are a number of useful tricks using binary operations to quickly manipulate bitmasks that can be much faster than operating on an array of booleans."

The first snap toggles the first (powered) snapper to ON, which then starts passing power to the second snapper.
