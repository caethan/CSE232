      ">Maria imagines a white ring of thickness 1 cm around the last black ring.\n",
      ">Then she draws a new black ring of thickness 1 cm around that white ring.\n",

      "A ring with an inner radius $r$ has total area $\\pi (r+1)^2 - \\pi r^2$ - the area of the outer circle minus that of the inner circle.  It takes 1 unit of paint to cover an area of $\\pi$, so the total paint needed for the first ring (with inner radius $r$) is $(r+1)^2 - r^2$ or $2r + 1$.  The next ring has an inner radius that is 2 cm greater than the first ring - 1 cm for the first black ring and 1 cm for the white space which separates the two.  Thus, the paint required for it is $2(r+2) + 1$, or $2r + 5$.  Similarly, the third ring requires $2r + 9$ units of paint and the formula is $P(r,n) = 2r + 4n - 3$."
