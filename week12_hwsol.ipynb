      "We can construct an array of size 1999790 that contains bitmasks for subsets that sum to a particular integer.  We initialize the array with Nones, then fill it in as follows:  the subset $S_{x}$ for some sum $x$ is either $\\{x\\}$ if $x \\in S$ or $S_{x-n} + \\{n\\}$ if $S_{x-n}$ exists for some $n \\in S$.  We can simply loop through each possible subset sum, filling it in if we can, and if we ever try to fill in a sum that already exists, then we report those two subsets.  Unfortunately, for the Large input, we would need an array of size $5 \\times 10^{14}$, which is too large to work with."

      "There are $2^{500}$ possible subsets for the Large input, much larger than the largest possible subset sum, meaning (by the pigeonhole principle) there *must* be multiple ways of reaching some sum, and because there are so many subsets, paired sums are very likely to be found fairly quickly.  Even when only choosing subsets of size 6, we have ${500 \\choose 6} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{13}$ total subsets, which is close enough to the total number of sums that we are still very likely to be able to find matching subsets of size 6!  Thus, we'll simply keep generating random size 6 subsets, hashing them in a dictionary keyed to their sums.  When we find another random subset that has the same sum as one we've already generated, we'll return both of them."
