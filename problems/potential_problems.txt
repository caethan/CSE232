This should serve as a list of interesting problems from the GCJ, SPOJ, and TOJ problem sets and how they might fit well into the class





*** Week 1 (August 29) Introduction to Competitive Programming

Labwork

SPOJ 15710 - Iterated Sums - trivial implementation problem, good warmup
GCJ Qual 2013 - Tic-Tac-Toe-Tomek - more complicated implementation problem, with some tricky parsing
GCJ 1A 2013 - Bullseye - very good for showing implementation difficulties - some basic math, brute force and when it fails, limits of ints and floats
    Have them do small only in lab (large requires some more complicated thinking)

Homework
Full analysis of Bullseye from lab, including both small and large limits

*** Week 2 (September 5) Data Structures

Labwork

TOJ #1126 - Magnetic Storms - moving window maximum with a fixed window - good intro problem
TOJ #1067 - Disk Tree - good basic data structure question, good intro problem
GJC Qual 2008 - Train Timetable - pair of priority queues for each station, takes some mapping


Homework
TOJ 1037 - Memory Management
great problem with lots of data structures needed - an augmented priority queue along with a basic priority queue and a dictionary to help with the data, and once the (complicated!) data structures are set up, the problem becomes trivial.

*** Week 3 (September 12) Dynamic Programming (cover greedy & divide/conquer methods too)

GCJ 1B 2013 - Osmos - very simple little recursive greedy problem, useful for difference between greedy and DP problems
GCJ Qual 2009 - Welcome to Code Jam - clever little dynamic programming solution, with a bit of modular arithmetic
GCJ 1C 2008 - Increasing Speed Limits - count increasing subsequences of an array, dynamic programming solution with an interesting data structure
GCJ 1C 2009 - Bribe the Prisoners - very straightforward dynamic programming - good intro!
GCJ 1A 2010 - Make it Smooth - another DP problem, slightly more complex
GCJ 1C 2010 - Making Chess Boards - clever DP problem with some interesting data structure updates

*** Week 4 (September 19) Strings

GCJ 1A 2011 - The Killer Word - can be solved with an interesting suffix forest method (I think!)
GCJ 1B 2013 - Garbled Email - very fun DP/trie problem
GCJ 1C 2013 - Consonants - a fun little combinatorial problem with strings
TOJ 1102 - Strange Dialog - string splitting with small dictionary - nope, not gonna work - way too restrictive memory limits 
TOJ 1297 - Palindrome - longest consecutive palindrome in a 1000 char string

*** Week 5 (September 26) Binary Mathematics

GCJ Qual 2010 - Snapper Chain - clever little problem with xor operations, though solvable more simply
GCJ Qual 2011 - Candy Splitting - again, solution itself is simple, but analysis requires some binary math
GCJ 1A 2014 - Charging Chaos - binary encoding of flips?

*** Week 6 (October 3) Introduction to Graph Theory 

GCJ 1B 2009 - Square Math - BFS on a non-canonical graph
GCJ 1C 2012 - Diamond Inheritance - simple path analysis on a directed graph

*** Week 7 (October 10) More Graph Theory

GCJ Qual 2013 - Treasure - tricky graph theory problem!
GCJ 1A 2009 - Crossing the Road - slightly modified shortest path problem
GCJ 2 2014 - Don't Break the Nile - max flow / min cut problem on an interesting graph

*** Week 8 (October 24) Computational Geometry

GCJ Qual 2008 - Fly Swatter - just takes some straightforward geometry to do the calculations
GCJ Qual 2012 - Hall of Mirrors - fairly complex comp geometry problem with some data structures required!
GCJ 1C 2009 - Center of Mass - very straightforward, good intro problem

*** Week 9 (October 31) Regional ICPC & Practice Competition 

We'll do a practice competition here - pick out 2-3 problems to solve

*** Week 10 (November 7) Probability and Combinatorics 

combinatoric games
binomial numbers


GCJ 1A 2009 - Collecting Cards - expected number calculations
GCJ 1A 2010 - Number Game - simple combinatorial game, possibly good for discussion
GCJ 1C 2010 - Rope Intranet - # of inversions in a permutation
GCJ 1A 2012 - Password Problem - interesting probability problem with expected calculations
GCJ 1A 2013 - Good Luck - tricky probability problem with some number theory
GCJ 1B 2013 - Falling Diamonds - good probability analysis with binomial coefficients needed
GCJ 1A 2014 - Proper Shuffle - another problem with probabilistic analysis of permutations

*** Week 11 (November 14) Number Theory

GCJ 1B 2008 - Number Sets - prime numbers!
GCJ 1C 2008 - Ugly Numbers - prime numbers, chinese remainder theorem with a dynamic programming solution

*** Week 12 (November 21) Random Algorithms

monte carlo area calculations, etc.
do we need an answer or the answer?
how many valid answers are there and are we likely to get one with random chance?
reservoir sampling
pseudorandom number generators (be careful!)

GCJ 1B 2012 - Equal Sums - great combinatorics problem with a good random solution!  Great for discussion.
GCJ 2 2012 - Aerobics - random placement works!

*** Week 13 (December 5) Hard Problems

GCJ Round 1A 2008 - Milkshakes - minor variation on a SAT problem that makes it not NP hard anymore!
