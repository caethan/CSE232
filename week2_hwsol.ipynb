      "\n",
      "This week, we're going to go through [TOJ 1037 - Memory Management](http://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1037).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the problem statement (rewritten slightly for improved clarity):\n",
      "\n",
      "> Our operating system will allocate memory in pieces that we\u2019ll call \u201cblocks\u201d. \n",
      "> The blocks are numbered by integers from 1 to $N$. \n",
      "> When the operating system needs more memory it makes a request to the memory management module. \n",
      "> To process this request, the memory management module needs to find the free memory block with the least number. \n",
      "> You may assume that there are enough blocks to process all requests.\n",
      "> Now we should define the meaning of words \u201cfree block\u201d. \n",
      "> At the moment of the first request to the memory management module all blocks are considered to be free. \n",
      "> A block also becomes free when there have been no requests to it for $T$ minutes.\n",
      "> The memory management module may also request access to previously allocated blocks.\n",
      "> To process this request the memory management module should first check if the requested block is really allocated. \n",
      "> If it is, the request is considered to be successful and the block remains allocated for a further $T$ minutes. \n",
      "> Otherwise the request fails.\n",
      "> You are to implement these algorithms for $N = 30,000$ and $T = 10$ minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "> #### Input\n",
      "> Each line of input contains a request for memory block allocation or memory block access. \n",
      "> Memory allocation request has the form:\n",
      "\n",
      "> $Time$ +\n",
      "\n",
      "> where $Time$ is a nonnegative integer number not greater than 65,000. \n",
      "> Time is given in seconds. \n",
      "> Memory block access request has the form:\n",
      "\n",
      "> $Time$ . $BlockNo$\n",
      "\n",
      "> where Time is as described above and $BlockNo$ is an integer value from 1 to N.\n",
      "> There will be no more than 80000 requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "> #### Output\n",
      "> For each line of input you should print exactly one line with the result of the request processing. \n",
      "> For a memory allocation request you are to write an integer with the number of the allocated block. \n",
      "> As it was mentioned above you may assume that every request can be satisfied, and there will be no more than N simultaneously allocated blocks. \n",
      "> For a memory block access request you should print only the character '+' if the request is successful (i.e. the block is really allocated) or '-' if the request fails (i.e. the block with number given is free, so it can't be accessed).\n",
      "> Requests are arranged by their times in an increasing order. \n",
      "> Requests with equal times should be processed as they appear in input."
